the classes in src2 are either supplements 
to the CDK code required here for the transpiler
to produce additional JavaScript or modifications
I have made in the CDK code itself. Ideally, the 
CDK code would be folded into the CDK project. 

The FreeHep code here is just a place-holder class
to prevent compile errors in Eclipse.
